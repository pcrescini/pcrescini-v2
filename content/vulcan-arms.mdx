VULCAN Arms is the leading direct-to-consumer brand for premium firearm accessories. By cutting out the middlemen, leveraging social media, and utilizing global distribution networks, we can provide innovative and premium products at affordable prices worldwide.

VULCAN acquired the help of Cart.com's Growth Marketing team to design, develop, and deliver various media campaigns.

One campaign required building an email campaign landing page on Vulcan's Shopify storefront. As the front-end developer for this project with no prior Shopify experience, I had to quickly familiarize myself with Shopify's theme architecture and Liquid templating language.

Once I had a solid grasp, I created a new layout based on Vulcan's existing theme and then built out new custom sections following the Figma design created by our internal design team.
