Invesco Indexing is a collection of proprietary financial indexes that leverage the global scale of Invesco â€” one of the world's premier global investment management firms.

Before launching their indexes to the public, the company wanted a website to house all index information separate from their U.S. product center. At the time, the Invesco Americas Marketing & Technology team was exploring new content management systems and decided to build out this website on Magnolia, an enterprise headless content management system.

As one of the front-end members of the Scrum team assigned to this project, I was responsible for creating and styling the page and component templates used on the home page, the equity and fixed income indexes landing pages, and the individual index detail pages.

Additionally, I took on the role of lead CMS author, overseeing the creation of pages, uploading assets, and implementing content for new product launches.
