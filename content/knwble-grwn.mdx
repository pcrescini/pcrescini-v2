Knwble Grwn is a brand with a mission to support what matters most to people and the planet. Their products are produced by small or traditionally underrepresented farmers who use regenerative agricultural practices to help protect the environment.

Knwble Grwn partnered with Cart.com in 2022 to expand its ecommerce channels beyond Amazon.

Since they did not initially require the full ecommerce capabilities of the Cart Storefront, I built a landing page based on Figma designs created by our internal design team.

I enjoyed working on this project as it was fun to build out a design that was both simple and elegant.
