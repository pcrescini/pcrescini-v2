TheManRefined is an independent menswear retailer specializing in making high-quality, custom-made garments that don't break the bank.

TheManRefined migrated its e-commerce store over to Cart.com in 2022. I was one of three front-end web developers responsible for building their new ecommerce website on the Cart Storefront platform.

My responsibilities included building out the following pages and templates based on the company's brand guidelines and the Figma designs created by our internal design team:

- Category Page Template with a Customizable Promotional Widget
- My Account Pages <small>(Overview, Orders, Wishlist, Payment Info)</small>
- Login, Logout & Forgot Password Pages
- Ecommerce Transactional Email Templates <small>(Account Registration, Lost Password, Order Confirmation, Order Shipped, Gift Certificate)</small>
