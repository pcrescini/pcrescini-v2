I joined Toastmasters International in July 2015 and have given countless speeches at my clubs, Talking Bull Toastmasters and All Star Toastmasters.

One of the skills we practice in Toastmasters is speaking within our allotted time. During speeches, a designated timer keeps track of the time and provides visual clues to the speaker when they are near the end of their allotted time.

When the pandemic forced Toastmasters clubs to meet virtually, having an easy-to-use and readily accessible digital timing tool for speeches was paramount. I found the timer app on my smartphone cumbersome, so I created this tool to simplify things.
